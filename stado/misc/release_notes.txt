Release Notes for Stado version 2.5
-------------------------------------

This software requires the Java Runtime Environment 5,
version 1.5.0_12 or later. Earlier versions of the JRE may 
result in memory leaks that over time result in an OutOfMemory
exception. 

Stado has also been successfully tested with Java 6 update 18,
and is recommended. 

If Stado was not installed via an installer that included a
JRE, please go to http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp 
to download a Java Runtime Environment 

After installing, please make sure that your PATH environment
variable refers to the JRE's bin directory.


This version includes enhancements, performance improvements 
and minor bug fixes, including

- Support for PostGIS 1.5 queries
- Faster database row shipping through the use of PostgreSQL
  unlogged tables

0.9 Release Notes
-----------------
The two new major features are Oracle compatiblity and support for 
the PostgreSQL protocol.

Oracle compatibility for Postgres Plus Advanced Server was added, 
including support for:
 - functions 
 - operators
 - data types
 - (+) outer join syntax (left joins only)
 - FROM DUAL syntax

Support for the PostgreSQL protocol was added.
This means there is no need to use the legacy Stado drivers;
users can connect to Stado using EnterpriseDB's or PostgreSQL's 
JDBC, ODBC and .NET drivers. Other drivers were not tested.
Users may also connect to Stado using psql or edb-psql, passing 
in the proper port with -p (default 6453).

To also facilitate moving to the PostgreSQL protocol, some 
additional SQL commands were added: CREATE DATABASE, DROP DATABSE,
START DATABASE, STOP DATABASE, and SHUTDOWN.

Support for a subset of the COPY command was also added. 
The gs-loader utility now internally makes use of the COPY protocol
and some of the options have been modified as a result.

In addition, various minor changes were made for better 
Postgres Plus Advanced Server integration.

Additional Changes:

- Made users global across Stado, instead of being specific to a database
- Added limited parameter support for PreparedStatements,
  and improved handling on server to avoid reparsing and replanning.
- Added support for EnterpriseDB SHOW commands
- Added support for ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN.
- Added support for ILIKE, SIMILAR TO, and ~
- Added support for current_user(), a synonym for user().
- Performance enhancements, including batches, ANALYZE, result combining, 
  UPDATE and DELETE

Known Issues
------------
The xdbimpex utility has a bug with the -c option, commit interval. It is
recommended to use COPY FROM or gs-loader anyway.

Some forms of correlated subqueries in the HAVING clause currently do not
work.

ORDER BY on the boolean and interval data types is not sorted properly.
